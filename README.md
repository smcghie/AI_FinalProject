# AI_FinalProject

In this project a dataset for bank marketing is taken and uploaded into the system. The dataset contains various information about banking clients of the bank, such as their age, job, marital status and other personal information. Using this data as the sample, a comparison of the accuracy of the different models is performed to determine their effectiveness. Logistic regression returns the most accurate predictions of the outcome, yet it is also takes the longest time to complete. After determining the top models for this dataset, the best of them are then modelled individually to see an assortment of individual tests, the mean of these aligning with the original comparison. The best models are then tuned. After this tuning, our most accurate model is then run through a series of plotting matrices and plotted models. A prediction model is then completed to compare our original accuracy to the accuracy achieved on the tuned results. The model is then finalized and then applied to the unseen dataset, then saved for later usage.
